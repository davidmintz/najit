                    This is a pilot project. NAJIT is testing Discourse to determine whether to adopt it as our online discussion platform. When you participate 
                    in this project, besides adhering to the customary and conventional terms and conditions (don't do anything illegal or abusive) you 
                    should also be aware of the following points:
                    <ul class="intro">
                        <li>This Discourse site for current NAJIT members only.</li>
                        <li>If and when NAJIT launches its official Discourse site, we do not yet know whether the user accounts and data will be migrated from the 
                    pilot. Whatever you post during the pilot phase might not be preserved, and you might have to create your user account again.</li>
                        <li>The email address you use to register for Discourse must be the same one in your NAJIT membership record. That's because 
                        we use it to identify you as a NAJIT member.</li>
                    </ul>
